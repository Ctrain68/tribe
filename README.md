# Tribe accountability
An accountability app for individuals or groups. The purpose of this app is for 
individuals to be held accountable to their goals through friends or acquaintances 
who can monitor the individuals progress to hitting the goals/targets/habits/changes that 
they wish to be accountable for. THis will included a forum type chat section (private and public)
as well as a method of reviewing and approving the individuals actions. At this stage that shall
be via photo approval of the action however depending on what is being tracked there are other avenues to 
explore. The idea is that the Tribe helps to hold eachother accountable and lift people.

A group accountability function is also going to be implemented so that a team or workplace 
can also hold eachother accountable to the team goals/culture/habits with a similar functionality 
to the individual one.

There will be a penalty system and ideally this will be based on the agreements with the people holding
the others accountable. However in the future we shall explore other ways to help leverage people's own
bias and dislikes to achieve the changes they are looking for. (an example of this 
is an automatic payment set up to donate money to your most despised political party/organisation for every time you fail
to meet the targets you set yourself.)
